This is Our Open Android BrandTrack. Built on the Android 4.1 Platform.

BrandTrack is an android application that helps you to track your favorite brand. It keeps you updated with your favorite Brand details like Nearby Locations, Discounts, Deals going on, Special offers
It can also act as a reminder of the expiry date of the coupons. This application allows multiple users to create their separate checklist.
 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-------------------
   This is an open source project for the Android platform. It is an Android App that Keeps track of some particular brands in which user is interested. When the user clicks on "Start" button, the app fetches the deals in some big websites to show up in this phone. If there are not something news, this app will fetch deals of the day before. When the user clicks on "Stop" button, it stops the appllication and does not run any services scheduled in future by the app.
-------------------

PROJECT MOTIVATION
------------------
   This is an open source project for the Android platform. It is an Android App that help you to check some new deals. Our thinking about this project is hoping that people can be easy to check the new deals. When a person come some places or some malls where they want to know which stores have the latest deals, they can use our app to checkout the hot money saving options in stores. 
------------------

Future Enhancements
------------------
   In the future, we will apply the current place on this app. For example, if you go somewhere or some places, this apps will find your's current location and fetch data about the store near this location. After that, this apps will find some deals about these stores and give it for the customers.
------------------
 
�Presently BrandTrack is saving all the information that you entered in its database, update the tracking information and remembers that for you.
  Later when you checklist the specific coupon it will tag that coupon for you so that when you are gone you dont forget to use it.
 �We intend to add the google maps in it so that it also gives you the direction, map of the store location, deals pop-ups whenever you are around the store.
